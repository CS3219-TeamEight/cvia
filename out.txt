Assignments 3 : Extend CodeCraft   
# Previously in CS3219 Assignment 2 
 
You are now a summer intern in PonyTech. You are assigned to extend CodeCraft. 
CodeCraft has a huge code base and it is an open source project contributed by many 
people. You decided to begin with making a table, showing web socket communication 
protocols between clients and server.  
 
# Understanding CodeCraft 
 
After making the table, you gained some degree of understanding of the code structure 
and coding style. Some part of the code is well documented but some of them are 
disastrous. You spent long time understanding the pattern and idea behind the code.  
 
CodeCraft is different, or unconventional. HTML and CSS do not play big roles in its front 
end. It is JavaScript that created everything you see. A simple dialog box is purely written 
in JavaScript. No HTML, no CSS. JavaScript is not only used to write app logic, it is also 
used to style the front end. 
 
 
Figure 1 
 
Code that creates such a dialog box (Figure 1) can be found in gui.js (line 2753 - 2823). 
 
After a week of source code reading, you realise that reading it aimlessly won’t get you 
anywhere. You decided to do some hacking.

You wanted to add an announcement feature on top of Sharebox’s existing feature.  
 
Here is the announcement feature requirement: 
 
 
# Tasks 
TASK 1 
Implement an announcement feature as per the requirements given above. You may use 
JavaScript native popup boxes. (http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_popup.asp) 
TASK 2 
Implement CodeCraft style GUI (similar to Figure 1) for the announcement feature. 
  
? Creator of the Sharebox should be able to broadcast announcement to the 
rest of the sharebox members. 
 
? Creator of the sharebox should be notified when all members have closed 
(read) the announcement. 
 
? Sharebox members should be able to receive announcement from the 
creator of the sharebox. 
 
? Sharebox members should be able to close announcement dialog box.
